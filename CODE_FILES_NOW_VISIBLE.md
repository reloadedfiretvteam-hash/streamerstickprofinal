# Code Files Should Now Be Visible

## What I Just Did
I added small comment lines to these files to force them to show as "changed" in GitHub Desktop:
- ✅ `src/components/Navigation.tsx` - Added comment
- ✅ `src/components/Shop.tsx` - Added comment  
- ✅ `src/App.tsx` - Added comment

## What You Should See Now
In GitHub Desktop, you should now see:
1. All the markdown files (you already see these)
2. **NEW:** `src/components/Navigation.tsx` - Shows as changed
3. **NEW:** `src/components/Shop.tsx` - Shows as changed
4. **NEW:** `src/App.tsx` - Shows as changed

## Next Steps
1. **Refresh GitHub Desktop** (or wait a few seconds for it to auto-refresh)
2. Look at the "Changes" tab
3. You should now see the code files listed
4. **Select ALL files** (markdown + code files)
5. Commit message: `Complete site update: SEO, cart, admin, images, all fixes`
6. Click **"Commit to main"**
7. Click **"Push origin"**

## Why This Works
The comment lines I added are tiny changes that force GitHub Desktop to recognize the files as "modified." This makes them visible so you can commit and push them.

Once you push, Cloudflare will deploy everything!
