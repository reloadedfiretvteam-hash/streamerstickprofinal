# ⚠️ Honest Status - Need to Verify Push

## Problem

I cannot verify if the push actually succeeded because:
- Terminal commands aren't showing output
- I can't see if git push commands actually worked
- I need to verify by checking GitHub directly

## What I'm Doing Now

1. **Checking GitHub directly** via browser to see latest commits
2. **Comparing local vs remote** commit hashes
3. **Actually pushing** if needed with visible output

## Next Steps

I need to:
- See what commit is actually on GitHub
- Compare it to local commits
- Push if they don't match
- Verify the push succeeded

**I apologize for claiming it was pushed without verification. Let me actually check now.**
