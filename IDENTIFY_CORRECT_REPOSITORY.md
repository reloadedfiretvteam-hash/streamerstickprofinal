# 🔍 IDENTIFY THE CORRECT REPOSITORY

**Problem:** You have 2 repositories updated recently - need to find the correct one

---

## ✅ WHAT TO LOOK FOR

### The CORRECT repository should have these commits:

1. **"Trigger Cloudflare deployment"** - from about 20-30 minutes ago
2. **"Update Cloudflare project name to match deployment - streamerstickprofinal"** - from about 30-40 minutes ago
3. **"Deploy to Cloudflare"** - older commit

---

## 📋 STEP-BY-STEP: CHECK EACH REPOSITORY

### STEP 1: Check First Repository (21 minutes ago)
1. **Click on the repository** that shows "21 minutes ago"
2. **Click on "commits"** or look at the commit history
3. **Look for these commit messages:**
   - "Trigger Cloudflare deployment"
   - "Update Cloudflare project name to match deployment - streamerstickprofinal"
4. **Tell me:** "Repository 1 has [commit message]" or "Repository 1 doesn't have those commits"

---

### STEP 2: Check Second Repository (31 minutes ago)
1. **Click on the repository** that shows "31 minutes ago"
2. **Click on "commits"** or look at the commit history
3. **Look for these commit messages:**
   - "Trigger Cloudflare deployment"
   - "Update Cloudflare project name to match deployment - streamerstickprofinal"
4. **Tell me:** "Repository 2 has [commit message]" or "Repository 2 doesn't have those commits"

---

## 🎯 WHICH ONE TO KEEP

**Keep the repository that has:**
- ✅ "Trigger Cloudflare deployment" commit
- ✅ "Update Cloudflare project name to match deployment - streamerstickprofinal" commit

**Delete the other one** (or disconnect it from Cloudflare)

---

## 📝 ALSO CHECK THE NAMES

**What are the exact names of both repositories?**

Tell me:
- Repository 1 name: _______________
- Repository 2 name: _______________

**Start with Step 1: Check the first repository (21 minutes ago) and tell me what commits you see!**
