# Fix Push Error - "Unable to... 14 of 14"

## What Happened
When you pushed, there were conflicts or errors with 14 files. This usually means:
- Some files conflicted with what's on GitHub
- The push partially failed
- Files might have been reverted

## Quick Fix: Force Push

### Step 1: Check What's in GitHub Desktop Now
1. Look at the left sidebar in GitHub Desktop
2. Do you see files listed under "Changes"?
   - If YES → Go to Step 2
   - If NO → Go to Step 3

### Step 2: If Files Are Still There
1. Click **"Repository"** menu
2. Click **"Push"**
3. If it asks about conflicts, click **"Force Push"** or **"Push with Force"**
4. This will overwrite GitHub with your local files

### Step 3: If Files Disappeared (Everything is Gone)
1. The files are still on your computer, just not showing in GitHub Desktop
2. Go back to File Explorer
3. Navigate to your GitHub Desktop folder (the one you pasted into)
4. Check if the files are still there
5. If files ARE there → Go back to GitHub Desktop and refresh (F5)
6. If files are NOT there → We need to copy from BXQ3Z again

## Alternative: Check GitHub Website
1. Go to: https://github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
2. Check if your files are there
3. If they ARE there → The push worked, GitHub Desktop just needs to refresh
4. If they're NOT there → We need to force push

## Tell Me:
1. Do you see files in GitHub Desktop now? (Yes/No)
2. What does the error message say exactly? (Copy the full error)
3. Are the files still in your File Explorer folder? (Yes/No)
