# Secrets Removed - Ready to Push

## ✅ What I Fixed
I removed all exposed GitHub tokens from these files:
- TROUBLESHOOT_PUSH_ISSUE.md
- SIMPLE_PUSH_COMMANDS.txt
- MASTER_REFERENCE_ALL_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- FRESH_CLONE_SOLUTION.md
- COMPLETE_PROJECT_INFORMATION.md
- BOLT_VERIFY_AND_PUSH_ALL_FILES.txt
- BOLT_FRESH_CLONE_INSTRUCTIONS.txt
- BOLT_EXACT_FILE_INSTRUCTIONS.txt

## Now: Push Again

### Step 1: Go to GitHub Desktop
1. Open **GitHub Desktop**
2. You should see files listed (if they disappeared, copy from BXQ3Z again)

### Step 2: Commit
1. Type commit message: `Remove exposed secrets and complete site updates`
2. Click **"Commit to main"**

### Step 3: Push
1. Click **"Push origin"**
2. **This time it should work** - no secrets blocking it!
3. If it says "behind", use **Force Push**

## Important: Revoke Those Tokens
The tokens I removed were:
- `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`
- `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`

**Go to:** https://github.com/settings/tokens
**Revoke both tokens** to keep your account safe!
