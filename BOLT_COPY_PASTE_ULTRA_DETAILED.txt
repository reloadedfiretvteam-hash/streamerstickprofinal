I need extremely detailed step-by-step instructions. I'm having trouble finding files and fixing the deployment.

THE PROBLEM:
- Template website keeps showing instead of my real website
- Need to find files in GitHub repository
- Need to fix Cloudflare domain connection
- Need to trigger deployment
- Need to add secure subdomain for Square payments

GITHUB REPOSITORY:
- URL: https://github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
- Owner: reloadedfiretvteam-hash
- Repository name: streamerstickprofinal
- Branch: main

WHAT TO FIND IN GITHUB:
1. Go to the repository URL above
2. Look for folder named "src" - click on it, should see many files
3. Look for folder named "public" - click on it, should see images and files
4. Look for file named "package.json" - in the root (not in a folder)
5. Look for file named "wrangler.toml" - in the root
6. Look for file named ".nvmrc" - in the root, should contain "20"

If any of these are missing, files are NOT pushed. Tell me which ones are missing.

CLOUDFLARE LOCATION:
- Dashboard: https://dash.cloudflare.com
- Go to: Pages (in left sidebar)
- You should see TWO projects:
  * Template project (WRONG - has my domain, shows template)
  * streamerstickprofinal (CORRECT - has my real code, needs my domain)

FIX DOMAIN CONNECTION:
1. Click on TEMPLATE project (the one showing template website)
2. Click "Domains" tab at the top
3. Find my domain in the list
4. Click "Remove" or "Disconnect" next to my domain
5. Confirm removal
6. Go back to Pages dashboard
7. Click on "streamerstickprofinal" project (the correct one)
8. Click "Domains" tab
9. Click "Add custom domain" button
10. Type my main domain (e.g., streamstickpro.com)
11. Click "Add" or "Continue"
12. Click "Add custom domain" AGAIN
13. Type my secure subdomain: secure.streamstickpro.com
14. Click "Add" or "Continue"

TRIGGER DEPLOYMENT:
1. In "streamerstickprofinal" project
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Click "Create deployment" button (top right)
4. Click "Deploy latest commit"
5. Click "Deploy"
6. Wait for status to show "Building" then "Success"

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
- Deployment status should be "Building" then "Success"
- If it says "Failed", click on it and check build logs
- Build logs should show "Installing dependencies" and "Building project"
- If you see errors, tell me what they say

MODIFICATIONS MADE TODAY:
- Added .nvmrc file (Node version 20)
- Updated wrangler.toml (project name)
- All files in src/ folder (136+ files)
- All files in public/ folder (55+ files)

Give me step-by-step instructions for EACH task. Don't skip any steps. Tell me exactly where to click and what to look for.
