## ⚠️ ONE CRITICAL THING TO DO

### 🔴 Email Service Not Configured

**Problem:** Your email functions don't actually send emails yet!

**Impact:**
- ❌ Customers won't get their IPTV login credentials
- ❌ Customers won't get order confirmations
- ❌ You won't get admin notifications

**Fix:** See `EMAIL_FUNCTIONS_NOT_CONFIGURED.md` for step-by-step instructions

**Takes:** 30 minutes to set up Resend.com or SendGrid

**Priority:** HIGH (but doesn't block the current deployment)
