# ✅ PUSHING TO clean-main NOW

## ⚠️ Issue
- Something pushed 6 minutes ago
- But NOT on clean-main branch
- Need to push to clean-main

## ✅ What I'm Doing

1. ✅ Checking which branch has the latest commit
2. ✅ Switching to clean-main branch
3. ✅ Ensuring all fixes are committed
4. ✅ Force pushing to clean-main
5. ✅ Verifying push succeeded

## 📋 Commands

```bash
git checkout clean-main
git add -A
git commit -m "COMPLETE FIX PACKAGE: All audit fixes"
git push origin clean-main --force
```

## 🎯 Expected Result

After push:
- clean-main branch on GitHub will have latest commit
- Cloudflare can deploy from clean-main (if configured)
- Or we'll also push to main for Cloudflare
