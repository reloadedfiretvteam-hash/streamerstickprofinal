The force push is being rejected. Try this instead:

1. git checkout clean-main
   (Make sure you're on clean-main)

2. git remote set-url origin https://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@github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal.git
   (Set remote with token)

3. git push origin clean-main
   (Try push WITHOUT force first)

If that fails, then try:
4. git push origin clean-main --force

Tell me what error you see!
