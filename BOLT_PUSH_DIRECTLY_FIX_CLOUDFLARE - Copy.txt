URGENT: Files need to be in GitHub directly, then Cloudflare needs to deploy them

THE SITUATION:
- GitHub Desktop is not working for me
- Need to push files directly to GitHub using command line
- Then need to fix Cloudflare to deploy from the correct repository

STEP 1: PUSH FILES DIRECTLY TO GITHUB

Open PowerShell (as administrator) and run these commands:

1. Go to folder:
cd "C:\Users\rdela\Downloads\New folder (2)\streamerstickprofinal"

2. Add all files:
git add .

3. Commit:
git commit -m "Push all files directly to GitHub - complete website"

4. Force push:
git push origin main --force

5. Verify in GitHub:
Go to: https://github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
Check that ALL files are there (src/, public/, package.json, etc.)

STEP 2: FIX CLOUDFLARE DEPLOYMENT

After files are in GitHub:

1. Go to Cloudflare: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Click "Pages" in sidebar
3. Find project "streamerstickprofinal"
4. Click on it
5. Go to "Settings" → "Builds & deployments"
6. Verify it's connected to: reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
7. If not connected, click "Connect to Git" and connect it
8. Make sure "Auto-deploy from Git" is ENABLED

STEP 3: TRIGGER DEPLOYMENT

1. In "streamerstickprofinal" project
2. Go to "Deployments" tab
3. Click "Create deployment"
4. Click "Deploy latest commit"
5. Wait for it to build

STEP 4: FIX DOMAIN

1. Remove domain from template project (wrong one)
2. Add domain to "streamerstickprofinal" project (correct one)
3. Add secure subdomain: secure.streamstickpro.com

REPOSITORY DETAILS:
- GitHub: reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
- Cloudflare Project: streamerstickprofinal
- Branch: main

If GitHub Desktop isn't working, use PowerShell commands above to push directly.
