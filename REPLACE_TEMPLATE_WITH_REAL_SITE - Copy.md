# 🎯 REPLACE TEMPLATE WITH YOUR REAL WEBSITE

**Situation:**
- Your domain is already connected to a Cloudflare project
- That project shows a template (not your real website)
- We just connected your real repository to Cloudflare
- We need to make sure your domain points to the project with your real code

---

## ✅ WHAT WE JUST DID

1. ✅ Connected your real repository: `reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal`
2. ✅ Set up build settings correctly
3. ✅ Cloudflare should be building your real website now

---

## 🎯 WHAT WE NEED TO DO

### Option 1: Use the Same Project (Recommended)
If we reconnected the repository to the **existing project** that's already connected to your domain:
- ✅ Your domain should automatically show the new deployment
- ✅ Once the build finishes, your real site will replace the template

### Option 2: Connect Domain to New Project
If we created a **new project** (`streamerstickprofinal-v2`):
- We need to disconnect the domain from the old project
- Connect it to the new project with your real code

## 📋 CHECK DEPLOYMENT STATUS

**First, let's see if your real website is building:**

1. **Go to the "Deployments" tab** in Cloudflare
2. **Look for the latest deployment**
3. **Check the status:**
   - 🟡 "Building" = Your real site is compiling (good!)
   - 🟢 "Success" = Your real site is ready!
   - 🔴 "Failed" = There's an error (tell me)

4. **Tell me:** "I see [status]" or "Building" or "Success"

---

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

**If the deployment is building/successful:**
- Your real website will automatically replace the template
- Your domain should show your real site once the build finishes

**If we need to switch domains:**
- We'll disconnect from the template project
- Connect to the project with your real code

---

**Check the Deployments tab and tell me what status you see!**
