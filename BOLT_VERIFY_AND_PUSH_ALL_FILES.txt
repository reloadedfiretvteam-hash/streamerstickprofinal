URGENT: Files not showing in GitHub - need to verify and push everything

THE PROBLEM:
- Files are not showing in GitHub repository
- No recent changes visible
- Need to verify what's there and push all files

STEP 1: VERIFY WHAT'S IN GITHUB

1. Go to: https://github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
2. Check what you see:
   - Is the repository empty?
   - Are there any files?
   - What folders/files are visible?
3. Tell me EXACTLY what you see (or don't see)

STEP 2: VERIFY LOCAL FILES EXIST

Go to this EXACT folder:
C:\Users\rdela\Downloads\New folder (2)\streamerstickprofinal

Check that these exist:
- src/ folder (should have 136+ files)
- public/ folder (should have 55+ files)
- package.json (in root)
- vite.config.ts (in root)
- wrangler.toml (in root)
- .nvmrc (in root)

If these don't exist locally, tell me where the files actually are.

STEP 3: PUSH ALL FILES TO GITHUB

If files exist locally but not in GitHub:

1. Open PowerShell (as administrator)

2. Go to folder:
cd "C:\Users\rdela\Downloads\New folder (2)\streamerstickprofinal"

3. Check git status:
git status

4. Add ALL files:
git add -A

5. Check what will be committed:
git status

6. Commit everything:
git commit -m "Push all files to GitHub - complete website $(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss')"

7. Push to GitHub:
git push origin main --force

8. Verify in GitHub:
Go to: https://github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
Refresh the page
Check that src/, public/, and all files are now visible

REPOSITORY DETAILS:
- GitHub: reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
- Branch: main
- Token: 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

FILES THAT MUST BE IN GITHUB:
- src/ folder (136+ files - all your website code)
- public/ folder (55+ files - all images and assets)
- package.json
- vite.config.ts
- wrangler.toml
- .nvmrc
- index.html
- All configuration files

Give me step-by-step instructions:
1. First, check what's actually in GitHub right now
2. Then check if files exist locally
3. Then push all files if they're missing from GitHub
4. Verify everything is there after pushing
