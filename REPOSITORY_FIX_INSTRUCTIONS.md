# 🔧 Repository Access Fix - Instructions

## ❌ Problem
GitHub says: "Repository might have been deleted or renamed"

## ✅ Solution Options

### Option 1: Check Repository Name (Most Likely)

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash
2. **Find your repository** - Look for:
   - `streamstickprofinal`
   - `streamerstickprofinal` (with 'e')
   - `stream-stick-pro-final`
   - Or any similar name

3. **Tell me the exact name** and I'll update the remote URL

### Option 2: Repository Was Renamed

If you renamed it:
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Check the URL in your browser
3. Copy the exact URL
4. Tell me and I'll update it

### Option 3: Create New Repository

If the repository was deleted:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Name it: `streamstickprofinal` (or whatever you want)
3. **Don't initialize** with README/license
4. Tell me the exact repository name
5. I'll push all fixes there

### Option 4: Different Organization

If it's under a different account:
1. Check: https://github.com/[your-username]
2. Find the repository
3. Tell me the exact path: `username/repository-name`

## 🛠️ What I'll Do Once You Tell Me

1. Update the remote URL
2. Test the connection
3. Push all fixes
4. Verify deployment

## 📦 All Fixes Are Backed Up

I've created a backup of all fixes, so nothing will be lost.

## 🚀 Quick Fix

**If you know the repository name, just tell me:**
- "The repository is: `username/repo-name`"
- Or: "Create a new repository called: `repo-name`"

And I'll fix it immediately!

**All your fixes are safe and ready to push once we fix the repository URL.** ✅
