## Best Practices for Outreach

### Do's:
1. **Personalize every email** - Reference specific content from their site
2. **Provide value first** - What's in it for them?
3. **Keep it short** - Busy people skim emails
4. **Follow up** - Most links come from follow-up #1 or #2
5. **Track everything** - Know what's working
6. **Be patient** - Quality link building takes months

### Don'ts:
1. **Don't use generic templates** - "Dear Webmaster" = instant delete
2. **Don't buy links** - Google penalizes this
3. **Don't spam** - Quality > Quantity
4. **Don't be pushy** - Build relationships, not just links
5. **Don't ignore relevance** - Only reach out to relevant sites
6. **Don't forget anchor text diversity** - Mix up your link text

---

## Monthly Outreach Goals

| Month | Emails Sent | Target Response Rate | Target Links Acquired |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | 100 | 10% | 5-10 |
| 2 | 100 | 12% | 8-12 |
| 3 | 100 | 15% | 10-15 |

After 3 months, evaluate which templates and targets perform best, then double down on what works.
