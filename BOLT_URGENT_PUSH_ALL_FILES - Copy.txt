URGENT: Push ALL files to GitHub - Template website keeps showing

THE PROBLEM:
- Template website keeps showing instead of my real website
- Files might not be in GitHub
- Need to push everything from local folder to GitHub

EXACT FOLDER LOCATION:
C:\Users\rdela\Downloads\New folder (2)\streamerstickprofinal

WHAT TO DO:

1. Open PowerShell (as administrator)

2. Go to the exact folder:
cd "C:\Users\rdela\Downloads\New folder (2)\streamerstickprofinal"

3. Verify files are there:
dir
(You should see src/, public/, package.json, etc.)

4. Add ALL files:
git add .

5. Commit everything:
git commit -m "Push all files - complete website with all updates"

6. Force push to GitHub:
git push origin main --force

7. Verify in GitHub:
Go to: https://github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
Check that src/ folder, public/ folder, and all files are there

IMPORTANT FILES THAT MUST BE PUSHED:
- Everything in src/ folder (your website code)
- Everything in public/ folder (images, assets)
- package.json
- vite.config.ts
- wrangler.toml
- .nvmrc
- index.html
- All configuration files

REPOSITORY:
- GitHub: reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
- Branch: main

If files are still not showing in GitHub after pushing, tell me what error you get.
