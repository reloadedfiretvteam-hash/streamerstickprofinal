URGENT: GitHub Desktop stuck in rebase - need to clone fresh repository

THE PROBLEM:
- GitHub Desktop keeps getting stuck in rebase
- Can't push files
- Need to clone repository fresh and start over

SOLUTION: FRESH CLONE

STEP 1: CLONE FRESH REPOSITORY

Open PowerShell (as administrator) and run:

cd "C:\Users\rdela\Downloads"
git clone https://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@github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal.git streamerstickprofinal-fresh

This creates a fresh copy without any rebase issues.

STEP 2: COPY YOUR FILES

Your current files are in:
C:\Users\rdela\Downloads\New folder (2)\streamerstickprofinal

Copy these to the fresh clone:
- src/ folder (all your code)
- public/ folder (all images/assets)
- package.json
- vite.config.ts
- wrangler.toml
- .nvmrc
- index.html
- All other files

Overwrite files in fresh clone with your current files.

STEP 3: PUSH FRESH CLONE

cd "C:\Users\rdela\Downloads\streamerstickprofinal-fresh"
git add .
git commit -m "Fresh clone - complete website with all files"
git push origin main --force

STEP 4: VERIFY

Go to: https://github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
Check that all files are there.

REPOSITORY INFO:
- GitHub: reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
- Token: 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
- Branch: main

All information is saved in files. Give me step-by-step instructions to clone fresh and push all files.
