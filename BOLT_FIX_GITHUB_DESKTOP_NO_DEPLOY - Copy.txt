URGENT: GitHub Desktop is stuck - need to fix it and push files WITHOUT deploying

THE PROBLEM:
- GitHub Desktop is stuck and won't work
- Need to remove/replace the stuck repository
- Need to push files to GitHub
- DO NOT deploy to Cloudflare yet - just push files

STEP 1: REMOVE STUCK REPOSITORY FROM GITHUB DESKTOP

1. Close GitHub Desktop completely
2. Open GitHub Desktop
3. Click "File" → "Options" or "Preferences"
4. Go to "Repositories" tab
5. Find the stuck repository (streamerstickprofinal)
6. Click "Remove" or delete it
7. Confirm removal

STEP 2: REDO GITHUB DESKTOP SETUP

1. In GitHub Desktop, click "File" → "Add Local Repository"
2. Click "Choose" button
3. Navigate to: C:\Users\rdela\Downloads\New folder (2)\streamerstickprofinal
4. Select that folder
5. Click "Add Repository"
6. Verify it appears in GitHub Desktop

STEP 3: PUSH FILES (IF GITHUB DESKTOP STILL DOESN'T WORK)

If GitHub Desktop still won't push, use PowerShell instead:

1. Open PowerShell (as administrator)
2. Run: cd "C:\Users\rdela\Downloads\New folder (2)\streamerstickprofinal"
3. Run: git add .
4. Run: git commit -m "Push all files - complete website"
5. Run: git push origin main --force

STEP 4: VERIFY FILES ARE IN GITHUB (NO DEPLOYMENT)

After pushing:
1. Go to: https://github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
2. Check that src/ folder is there
3. Check that public/ folder is there
4. Check that package.json, wrangler.toml, .nvmrc are there
5. Verify all files are present

IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT deploy to Cloudflare yet
- DO NOT trigger any builds
- Just verify files are in GitHub
- We'll do Cloudflare deployment separately after files are verified

REPOSITORY:
- GitHub: reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
- Local folder: C:\Users\rdela\Downloads\New folder (2)\streamerstickprofinal
