# Simple Way to Check if Files Are Updated on GitHub

## Easiest Method (No Technical Knowledge Needed)

### Step 1: Go to Your GitHub Repository
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: **https://github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal**
3. You'll see the main page

### Step 2: Check the Latest Commit
1. Look at the top of the page for the **latest commit message**
2. It will say something like:
   - "Complete site update: SEO, cart, admin, images, all fixes"
   - Or whatever commit message you used
3. **Check the DATE** - Is it from TODAY? (Nov 22, 2025)
   - If YES → Files were updated! ✅
   - If NO → Files weren't pushed yet ❌

### Step 3: Check File Count (Super Simple)
1. On the main repository page, look for a number that says:
   - **"X commits"** (total commits)
   - Or click on the latest commit
2. When you click a commit, it shows:
   - **"X files changed"** 
   - If it says a large number (like 653 or close) → Files are there! ✅

### Step 4: Quick Visual Check
1. On the main page, you should see folders like:
   - `src` folder
   - `public` folder
   - `package.json` file
2. If you see these → Your files are there! ✅

## That's It!
You don't need to open files. Just check:
- ✅ Latest commit date = TODAY?
- ✅ Large number of files changed?
- ✅ Folders visible?

If all YES → Your files are on GitHub! ✅
