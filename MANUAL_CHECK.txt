If the script doesn't show output, run these commands manually and tell me what you see:

1. git branch --show-current
   (What branch are you on?)

2. git remote -v
   (What remote URL shows?)

3. git status
   (Any uncommitted changes?)

4. git add -A
   (Stage everything)

5. git commit -m "COMPLETE FIX: All fixes consolidated"
   (Commit - does it say "nothing to commit" or show a commit?)

6. git push origin clean-main --force
   (What error or message do you see?)

Tell me the output of each step!
