Accessibility
These checks highlight opportunities to improve the accessibility of your web app. Automatic detection can only detect a subset of issues and does not guarantee the accessibility of your web app, so manual testing is also encouraged.
Names and labels
Buttons do not have an accessible name
Form elements do not have associated labels
Links do not have a discernible name
These are opportunities to improve the semantics of the controls in your application. This may enhance the experience for users of assistive technology, like a screen reader.
Best practices
[user-scalable="no"] is used in the <meta name="viewport"> element or the [maximum-scale] attribute is less than 5.
These items highlight common accessibility best practices.
Contrast
Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.
These are opportunities to improve the legibility of your content.
Audio and video
<video> elements contain a <track> element with [kind="captions"]
These are opportunities to provide alternative content for audio and video. This may improve the experience for users with hearing or vision impairments.
Additional items to manually check (10)
Show
These items address areas which an automated testing tool cannot cover. Learn more in our guide on conducting an accessibility review.
