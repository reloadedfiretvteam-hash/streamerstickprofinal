# 🚨 FILES NOT IN GITHUB - FIX NOW

**Problem:** Files not showing in GitHub, no recent changes

---

## 🔍 STEP 1: VERIFY WHAT'S IN GITHUB

**Go to:** https://github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal

**Check:**
- Is the repository empty?
- Are there any files visible?
- What do you see?

**Tell me exactly what you see (or don't see).**

---

## 📂 STEP 2: VERIFY LOCAL FILES

**Your files should be in:**
```
C:\Users\rdela\Downloads\New folder (2)\streamerstickprofinal
```

**Check that these exist:**
- ✅ `src/` folder (136+ files)
- ✅ `public/` folder (55+ files)
- ✅ `package.json`
- ✅ `vite.config.ts`
- ✅ `wrangler.toml`
- ✅ `.nvmrc`

**If these don't exist, tell me where your files actually are.**

---

## 🚀 STEP 3: PUSH ALL FILES

**If files exist locally but not in GitHub, push them:**

### Commands to Run:

```
cd "C:\Users\rdela\Downloads\New folder (2)\streamerstickprofinal"
```

```
git status
```

```
git add -A
```

```
git commit -m "Push all files to GitHub - complete website"
```

```
git push origin main --force
```

## ✅ STEP 4: VERIFY AFTER PUSHING

**After pushing:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
2. **Refresh the page**
3. **Check that you see:**
   - `src/` folder
   - `public/` folder
   - `package.json`
   - All other files

---

## 🎯 WHAT TO DO NOW

**First, tell me:**
1. What do you see when you go to the GitHub repository?
2. Are the files in the local folder?

**Then I'll help you push them directly to GitHub.**

**Check GitHub first, then we'll push all files if they're missing!**
