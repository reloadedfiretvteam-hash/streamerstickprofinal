# Thin Page Expansion Prompt

Use to expand thin plan-detail or device-detail pages (e.g. below 500 / 400 words).

## Prompt

```
For this StreamStickPro page:
- Template: [plan-detail | device-detail]
- Entity: [plan name or device name]
- Current word count: [N]
- Target: 500+ words (plan) or 400+ (device)

Output:
1. A 45–60 word direct answer to the main user intent (e.g. "What is the best 1-year IPTV plan?" or "How do I set up IPTV on Fire Stick 4K?").
2. A bullet list of 5 key benefits specific to this plan/device.
3. 5 FAQs with short answers (2–3 sentences each), optimized for voice and featured snippets. Topics: pricing, setup, compatibility, trial, support.
4. One optional "Related devices/plans" internal linking block (3–4 links with anchor text).

Keep tone conversion-focused, factual, and on-brand. No generic fluff.
