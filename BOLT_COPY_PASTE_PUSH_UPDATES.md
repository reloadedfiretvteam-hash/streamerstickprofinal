# 🚀 COPY-PASTE FOR BOLT: PUSH ALL UPDATES

**URGENT:** Website showing old version - need to push all files

---

## 📋 COPY THIS TO BOLT:

```
The website is showing the old version because not all files are pushed to GitHub.

I need you to:

1. Go to the repository folder:
   C:\Users\rdela\Downloads\New folder (2)\streamerstickprofinal

2. Check what files are NOT pushed:
   Run: git status
   Run: git log --oneline -5

3. Push EVERYTHING to GitHub:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Push all updates - complete website with all features from today"
   git push origin main

4. CRITICAL FILES THAT MUST BE PUSHED:
   - All files in src/ folder (all components, pages, etc.)
   - package.json
   - vite.config.ts
   - wrangler.toml
   - .nvmrc (Node version file - this was added today)
   - All files in public/ folder (images, assets)
   - All configuration files
   - Everything in the repository

5. VERIFY IT'S PUSHED:
   - Go to: https://github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
   - Check that ALL folders and files are there
   - Check the latest commit shows "Push all updates"

6. TRIGGER CLOUDFLARE DEPLOYMENT:
   - After pushing, Cloudflare should auto-deploy
   - If not, go to Cloudflare project "streamerstickprofinal"
   - Go to Deployments tab
   - Click "Retry deployment" or "Create deployment"
   - Select "Deploy latest commit"

IMPORTANT DETAILS:
- Repository: reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
- Branch: main
- Make sure you're in the correct folder before running git commands

If the website still shows old version after pushing:
- Check Cloudflare Deployments tab - is the build successful?
- Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
- Clear browser cache and refresh
- Check that Cloudflare is deploying from the latest commit

Please give me step-by-step instructions and verify each step is complete.
