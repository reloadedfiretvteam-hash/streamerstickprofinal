URGENT: Push ALL files to GitHub - Website showing old version

The website is showing the old version because not all files are pushed to GitHub.

WHAT TO DO:

1. Go to the repository folder:
   C:\Users\rdela\Downloads\New folder (2)\streamerstickprofinal

2. Check what's NOT pushed:
   Run: git status
   Run: git log --oneline -5

3. Push EVERYTHING:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Push all updates - complete website with all features"
   git push origin main

4. CRITICAL FILES THAT MUST BE PUSHED:
   - All files in src/ folder (components, pages, etc.)
   - package.json
   - vite.config.ts
   - wrangler.toml
   - .nvmrc (Node version file)
   - All files in public/ folder (images, assets)
   - All configuration files

5. VERIFY IT'S PUSHED:
   - Go to: https://github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
   - Check that all folders and files are there
   - Check the latest commit shows "Push all updates"

6. TRIGGER CLOUDFLARE DEPLOYMENT:
   - After pushing, Cloudflare should auto-deploy
   - If not, go to Cloudflare → Deployments → Retry deployment
   - Or create a new deployment from latest commit

IMPORTANT: Make sure you're in the correct folder and pushing to the correct repository:
- Repository: reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
- Branch: main

If the website still shows old version after pushing:
- Clear Cloudflare cache
- Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
- Check Cloudflare Deployments tab to see if build succeeded
