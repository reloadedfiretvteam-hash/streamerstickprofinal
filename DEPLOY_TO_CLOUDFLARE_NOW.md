# 🚀 DEPLOY TO CLOUDFLARE - SIMPLE STEPS

## 🎯 You Need to Trigger Cloudflare Deployment

Since you pushed to GitHub, Cloudflare needs to build and deploy the new code.

---

## ✅ STEP-BY-STEP:

### Step 1: Go to Cloudflare Dashboard

1. Open: **https://dash.cloudflare.com/**
2. Log in if needed
3. Click **"Workers & Pages"** (in left menu)
4. Find and click **your project** (your website name)

---

### Step 2: Go to Deployments

1. Click **"Deployments"** tab (at the top)
2. You'll see a list of deployments

---

### Step 3: Create New Deployment

**Look for one of these buttons:**
- **"Create deployment"** (most common)
- **"Retry deployment"** 
- **"Deploy"**
- **"Redeploy"**

**Click it!**

---

### Step 4: Select Branch

1. It will ask you to select a branch
2. Choose: **`clean-main`** (or `main` if that's what it shows)
3. Click **"Deploy"** or **"Start deployment"**

---

### Step 5: Wait

1. You'll see a build starting
2. Wait **2-3 minutes** for it to finish
3. You'll see "Success" when done

---

## ✅ DONE!

Your website will update with the new code!

---

## 🆘 IF YOU DON'T SEE "CREATE DEPLOYMENT" BUTTON:

**Check Settings:**

1. Go to: **Settings** → **Builds & deployments**
2. Look for:
   - **Production branch:** Should be `clean-main` or `main`
   - **Auto-deploy:** Should be enabled
3. If auto-deploy is OFF, turn it ON
4. Then go back to Deployments and try again
