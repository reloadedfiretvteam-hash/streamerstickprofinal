ADMIN CREDENTIALS SQL - ERROR-FREE VERSION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ WHAT WAS WRONG:
- Email typo: "reloadedfirestvteam" → Fixed to "reloadedfiretvteam"
- Function/trigger conflicts → Added DROP IF EXISTS with CASCADE
- Policy conflicts → Added DROP IF EXISTS for all policies

✅ WHAT I FIXED:
1. Email: reloadedfiretvteam@gmail.com (corrected)
2. Function drop with CASCADE to handle dependencies
3. All policies dropped before creating new ones
4. ON CONFLICT now updates instead of doing nothing

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HOW TO USE:

1. Go to: Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy the ENTIRE contents of: COPY_PASTE_FIXED_ADMIN_SQL.sql
3. Paste into SQL Editor
4. Click "Run"
5. Should see success message + verification query results

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

EXPECTED RESULT AFTER RUNNING:

You should see a SELECT query result showing:
- username: admin
- email: reloadedfiretvteam@gmail.com
- role: superadmin
- is_active: true

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LOGIN CREDENTIALS AFTER RUNNING:

Username: admin
Password: admin
Email: reloadedfiretvteam@gmail.com

Go to: /admin or /admin/ to log in

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

IF YOU STILL GET ERRORS:

Common errors and fixes:

❌ "relation already exists"
   → Table already exists - that's OK, SQL handles it with IF NOT EXISTS

❌ "policy already exists" 
   → Should be fixed now with DROP IF EXISTS statements

❌ "function already exists"
   → Should be fixed now with DROP FUNCTION CASCADE

❌ "permission denied"
   → Check you're logged into Supabase with correct permissions

❌ "syntax error"
   → Make sure you copied the ENTIRE SQL from COPY_PASTE_FIXED_ADMIN_SQL.sql
