To check if you're done, run this:

powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "CHECK_IF_DONE.ps1"

Or check GitHub directly:
https://github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal/commits/clean-main

Look for:
- Latest commit should be recent (just now)
- Should see "COMPLETE FIX: All fixes consolidated" or similar

If you see your latest commit on GitHub = YOU'RE DONE! ✅
If not = Need to push again
