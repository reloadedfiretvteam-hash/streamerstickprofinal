Since you have "no changes" (everything is committed), run these:

1. git branch --show-current
   (Tell me what this shows)

2. git checkout clean-main
   (Make sure you're on clean-main)

3. git remote remove origin
   (Remove old remote)

4. git remote add origin https://github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal.git
   (Add correct remote)

5. git push origin clean-main --force
   (Push to clean-main)

6. git push origin clean-main:main --force
   (Push to main for Cloudflare)

Tell me what step 1 shows and if step 5 gives any errors!
