I need help connecting my live domain to the correct Cloudflare Pages project.

CURRENT SITUATION:
- My domain is connected to a Cloudflare project that shows a template/placeholder site (wrong one)
- I have another Cloudflare project called "streamerstickprofinal" that has my real website code
- The real project is connected to GitHub repository: reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
- I need to move my domain from the template project to the real project

WHAT I NEED:
1. Remove my domain from the template project
2. Connect my domain to the "streamerstickprofinal" project (the one with my real code)

REPOSITORY DETAILS:
- GitHub: reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
- Cloudflare Project: streamerstickprofinal
- Both are already connected and working

Please help me:
1. First, ask me what my domain name is
2. Then guide me step-by-step to remove it from the template project
3. Then guide me step-by-step to add it to the "streamerstickprofinal" project

I'm not very technical, so please give me very clear, simple instructions.
