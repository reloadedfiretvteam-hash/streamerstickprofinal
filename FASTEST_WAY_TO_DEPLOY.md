   ```
5. Click **"Add Repository"**
6. GitHub Desktop will show ALL your changes

## Option 2: Copy Files to Your Existing Folder (5 minutes)

If you want to keep using your current GitHub Desktop folder:

### Steps:
1. **Open File Explorer** (two windows)
   
2. **Window 1** - Go to:
   ```
   C:\Users\rdela\.cursor\worktrees\streamerstickprofinal\BXQ3Z
   ```
   
3. **Window 2** - Go to your "folder five" (the one GitHub Desktop is watching)
   - You'll need to tell me the exact path, or find it in GitHub Desktop:
     - Open GitHub Desktop
     - Click **"Repository"** → **"Show in Explorer"**
     - That's your folder path

4. **Copy everything** from BXQ3Z folder to your folder five
   - Select all files in BXQ3Z (Ctrl+A)
   - Copy (Ctrl+C)
   - Paste into folder five (Ctrl+V)
   - Replace/overwrite if it asks

5. **Go back to GitHub Desktop**
   - You'll see all changes
   - Commit and push

## Which Should You Use?

**Use Option 1** - It's faster and the BXQ3Z folder already has everything.

**Use Option 2** - Only if you have a specific reason to keep using your current folder.
