# 🌐 CONNECT DOMAIN - FINAL STEPS

**Goal:** Connect your live domain to the project with your real code

---

## STEP 1: Go to Your Real Project

1. **Go to Cloudflare Pages dashboard**
2. **Click on the project** that has your real code (the one we just set up)
3. **Make sure it shows:** `reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal` as the repository

4. **Tell me:** "Step 1 done" or "I'm on the real project"

---

## STEP 2: Go to Domains Tab

1. **Click "Domains" tab** at the top
2. **Tell me:** "Step 2 done" or "I'm on Domains"

---

## STEP 3: Add Custom Domain

1. **Click "Add custom domain"** (or similar button)
2. **Enter your domain name**
   - What is your domain? (e.g., `streamstickpro.com`)
3. **Click "Add" or "Continue"**

4. **Tell me:** "Step 3 done" or "I entered [domain name]"

---

## STEP 4: Follow DNS Instructions

1. **Cloudflare will show DNS instructions**
2. **If it says "Already in Cloudflare":**
   - It should automatically connect
   - Click "Continue" or "Confirm"

3. **If it asks for DNS records:**
   - Tell me what it says
   - I'll help you add them

4. **Tell me:** "Step 4 done" or "What should I do next?"

## ⚠️ IF IT STILL SAYS "ALREADY TAKEN"

**Option 1: Wait 5-10 minutes**
- Sometimes Cloudflare needs time to release the domain
- Try again after waiting

**Option 2: Check all projects**
- Go to Pages dashboard
- Check ALL projects
- See if your domain is listed under any other project
- Remove it from there first

## 🎯 WHAT'S YOUR DOMAIN?

**Before we continue, tell me:**
- What is your live domain name?
- Is it `streamstickpro.com`?
- Or something else?
