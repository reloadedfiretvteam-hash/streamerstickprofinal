I need help with my Cloudflare Pages deployment and GitHub auto-deployment setup.

CURRENT SITUATION:
- My domain is connected to a Cloudflare project showing a template (wrong one)
- I have a Cloudflare project called "streamerstickprofinal" with my real website code
- The real project is connected to GitHub: reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
- I'm getting failed GitHub auto deployments

WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO:

1. CONNECT MY DOMAINS:
   - Remove my main domain from the template project
   - Remove my secure subdomain (secure.streamstickpro.com) from template project
   - Connect main domain to "streamerstickprofinal" project
   - Connect secure subdomain to "streamerstickprofinal" project (needed for Square payments)

2. VERIFY CODE IS IN GITHUB:
   - Check: https://github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
   - Make sure all files from today are there
   - If anything is missing, push it to GitHub

3. SET UP AUTO-DEPLOYMENT:
   - In Cloudflare project "streamerstickprofinal"
   - Go to Settings → Builds & deployments
   - Make sure "Auto-deploy from Git" is ENABLED
   - This should automatically deploy when code is pushed to GitHub

4. FIX FAILED DEPLOYMENTS:
   - Check GitHub Actions: https://github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal/actions
   - Find any failed workflows
   - Fix the errors
   - Test by making a small change and pushing to verify auto-deployment works

5. TEST AUTO-DEPLOYMENT:
   - Make a small test change
   - Push to GitHub
   - Verify Cloudflare automatically starts a new deployment
   - Make sure it completes successfully

IMPORTANT DETAILS:
- GitHub Repository: reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
- Cloudflare Project: streamerstickprofinal
- Build command: npm run build
- Build output: dist
- Node version: 20
- Payment processor: Square (needs secure subdomain)

I'm not very technical, so please give me clear step-by-step instructions for each task.
