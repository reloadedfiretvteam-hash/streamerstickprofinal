# ✅ DEPLOYMENT FIX APPLIED

**Date:** November 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Fixes pushed to GitHub

---

## ✅ WHAT I FIXED

1. ✅ **Added `.nvmrc` file** - Ensures Cloudflare uses Node.js version 20
2. ✅ **Verified build configuration** - All settings are correct
3. ✅ **Pushed to GitHub** - Changes are now in the repository

---

## 📋 CLOUDFLARE BUILD SETTINGS (Verify These)

**In Cloudflare Settings → Builds & deployments, make sure:**

- **Build command:** `npm run build`
- **Build output directory:** `dist`
- **Root directory:** `/` (or leave empty)
- **Node version:** `20` (should auto-detect from `.nvmrc`)

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for Cloudflare to detect the new push
2. **Check Deployments tab** - A new deployment should start automatically
3. **Watch the build** - It should succeed now

---

## ⏱️ TIMELINE

- **Now:** Fixes pushed to GitHub ✅
- **1-2 minutes:** Cloudflare detects the push
- **2-5 minutes:** Build completes
- **Total:** 3-7 minutes until your site is live

---

## 🔍 IF IT STILL FAILS

**Check the build logs and tell me:**
1. What error message appears?
2. At what step does it fail? (Installing, Building, Deploying)

---

**The fix has been applied! Cloudflare should automatically start a new deployment in 1-2 minutes.**
