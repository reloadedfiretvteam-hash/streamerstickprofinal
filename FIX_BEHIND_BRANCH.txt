Your branch is behind the remote. Do this:

1. git checkout clean-main
   (Make sure you're on clean-main)

2. git fetch origin clean-main
   (Get latest from remote)

3. git pull origin clean-main
   (Merge remote changes into your local branch)

4. git add -A
   (Stage any changes)

5. git commit -m "COMPLETE FIX: All fixes consolidated"
   (Commit if needed)

6. git push origin clean-main
   (Push - should work now without force)

7. git push origin clean-main:main --force
   (Push to main for Cloudflare)

Or run: powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "PULL_THEN_PUSH.ps1"
