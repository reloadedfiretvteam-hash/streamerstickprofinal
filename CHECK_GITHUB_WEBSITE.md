# How to Check if Files Are on GitHub Website

## Check Your GitHub Repository

### Step 1: Go to GitHub Website
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: **https://github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal**
3. (Or search for your repository on GitHub)

### Step 2: Check Recent Activity
1. Look at the main page of your repository
2. Check the **"commits"** section (usually on the right or at the top)
3. Do you see a recent commit? (Within the last few minutes?)
   - If YES → The push might have worked!
   - If NO → The push didn't work

### Step 3: Check File Count
1. On the main repository page, look for:
   - **"X files"** or **"X commits"** 
   - Or scroll down to see folders like `src/`, `public/`, etc.
2. Click on the **"src"** folder
3. Count or check if you see:
   - `App.tsx`
   - `components/` folder
   - `pages/` folder
   - All your files

### Step 4: Check Latest Commit
1. Click on the **"commits"** link (or the commit history)
2. Look at the most recent commit
3. Does it say something like:
   - "Complete site update" or your commit message?
   - Does it show "653 files changed" or a large number?
   - If YES → **The push worked!** ✅
   - If NO → The push didn't work

### Step 5: Check Branch
1. Look at the top of the repository page
2. Make sure you're looking at the **"main"** branch (not a different branch)

## What to Look For

**If the push WORKED:**
- ✅ Recent commit (last few minutes)
- ✅ Large number of files changed (653 or close to it)
- ✅ Your commit message visible
- ✅ All folders present (src/, public/, etc.)

**If the push FAILED:**
- ❌ No recent commits
- ❌ Old commit is still the latest
- ❌ Files/folders missing

## Tell Me What You See
After checking, tell me:
1. What's the date/time of the most recent commit?
2. How many files does it say were changed?
3. Do you see all your folders (src/, public/, etc.)?
