# EMERGENCY: Recover Your Files

## Good News ✅
Your files are SAFE in the BXQ3Z folder! They didn't disappear from there.

## What Happened
The files got removed from your GitHub Desktop folder, probably due to a conflict or failed merge.

## Fix: Copy Files Again (But This Time We'll Handle Conflicts)

### Step 1: Verify BXQ3Z Still Has Files
1. Open **File Explorer**
2. Go to: `C:\Users\rdela\.cursor\worktrees\streamerstickprofinal\BXQ3Z`
3. **Confirm files are there** (they should be!)

### Step 2: Find Your GitHub Desktop Folder
1. Open **GitHub Desktop**
2. Click **"Repository"** → **"Show in Explorer"**
3. **Write down this path** - This is your GitHub Desktop folder

### Step 3: Copy Files Again
1. In File Explorer, go to BXQ3Z folder
2. **Select ALL** (Ctrl+A)
3. **Copy** (Ctrl+C)

### Step 4: Paste into GitHub Desktop Folder
1. Go to your GitHub Desktop folder (from Step 2)
2. **Paste** (Ctrl+V)
3. If it asks to replace, click **"Yes to All"**

### Step 5: In GitHub Desktop - Handle Conflicts
1. You should see files appear
2. If it shows conflicts:
   - Click on each conflicted file
   - Choose **"Use Local"** or **"Keep Yours"** for all of them
3. **DO NOT PULL** - We're pushing YOUR version

### Step 6: Commit and Force Push
1. Type commit message: `Complete site: SEO, cart, admin, images, all fixes - Force push`
2. Click **"Commit to main"**
3. Click **"Repository"** → **"Push"**
4. If it asks about conflicts or "behind", click **"Force Push"** or **"Push with Force"**
5. Confirm the force push

## Important
- **DO NOT click "Pull"** - That will try to merge and cause more conflicts
- **Use Force Push** - This overwrites GitHub with your files
- Your files in BXQ3Z are safe - we're just copying them again
