# 🔧 Repository Access Fix

## ❌ Problem
Repository might have been deleted or renamed.

## 🔍 What I'm Checking

1. Current remote URL
2. Connection test
3. Repository name verification
4. Token access

## 🛠️ Possible Solutions

### Option 1: Repository Name Changed
If the repository was renamed, we need the new name:
- Check: https://github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash
- Find the correct repository name
- Update remote URL

### Option 2: Organization Changed
If it moved to a different organization:
- Check your GitHub account
- Find where the repository is now
- Update remote URL

### Option 3: Token Access Issue
If the token doesn't have access:
- Verify token has repo permissions
- Check if token is still valid
- May need new token

### Option 4: Repository Deleted
If repository was deleted:
- Need to create new repository
- Or restore from backup

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Check GitHub**: Go to https://github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash
2. **Find Repository**: Look for your repository
3. **Get Correct Name**: Note the exact repository name
4. **Update Remote**: I'll update the remote URL with the correct name

## 🔄 Alternative: Push to New Repository

If the repository was deleted, we can:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Update the remote URL
3. Push all fixes there
