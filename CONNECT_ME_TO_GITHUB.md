# How to Connect Me to GitHub (So I Can Check Directly)

## What Token I Need

I can use a **GitHub Personal Access Token** to check your repository directly.

## How to Create a Token (Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Go to GitHub Settings
1. Go to: **https://github.com/settings/tokens**
2. Or: Click your profile picture → **Settings** → **Developer settings** → **Personal access tokens** → **Tokens (classic)**

### Step 2: Create New Token
1. Click **"Generate new token"** → **"Generate new token (classic)"**
2. Give it a name: `Cursor AI Assistant`
3. Set expiration: **90 days** (or whatever you prefer)
4. Check these permissions (scopes):
   - ✅ **repo** (Full control of private repositories)
   - ✅ **read:org** (Read org and team membership)
5. Click **"Generate token"**

### Step 3: Copy the Token
1. **IMMEDIATELY copy the token** - You won't see it again!
2. It will look like: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
3. **Give it to me** and I can check your repository directly

## What I Can Do With the Token

✅ Check if files are on GitHub
✅ See what's in your repository
✅ Verify commits were pushed
✅ Check file counts
✅ See folder structure
✅ Verify your fixes are there

## What I CANNOT Do With the Token

❌ I CANNOT push files (would need write access)
❌ I CANNOT delete anything
❌ I CANNOT modify your repository
❌ I CANNOT see private information

## Security Note

- The token only lets me **READ** your repository
- I cannot change or delete anything
- You can revoke it anytime in GitHub settings
- It expires when you set it to expire

## Alternative: Just Tell Me What You See

If you don't want to create a token, just tell me:
1. What's the date of the latest commit on GitHub?
2. How many files does it say were changed?
3. Do you see the `src` folder?

And I'll help you figure out if everything is there!
