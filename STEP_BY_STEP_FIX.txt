Run these commands ONE AT A TIME and tell me what you see:

1. git branch --show-current
   (This shows what branch you're on)

2. git status
   (This shows if you have uncommitted changes)

3. git checkout clean-main
   (Switch to clean-main - if it says "error" tell me)

4. git remote -v
   (Shows the remote URL)

5. git remote remove origin
   (Remove old remote)

6. git remote add origin https://github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal.git
   (Add correct remote)

7. git add -A
   (Stage all changes)

8. git commit -m "COMPLETE FIX: All fixes consolidated"
   (Commit changes)

9. git push origin clean-main --force
   (Push to clean-main)

Tell me what errors you see at each step!
