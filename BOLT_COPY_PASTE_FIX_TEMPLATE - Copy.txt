URGENT: Template website keeps showing - need to fix Cloudflare domain connection

THE PROBLEM:
- Template website keeps appearing instead of my real website
- Files ARE in GitHub (already verified)
- The issue is: my domain is connected to the WRONG Cloudflare project

WHAT TO DO:

1. FIND THE TEMPLATE PROJECT:
   - Go to Cloudflare Pages dashboard
   - Find the project showing a template/placeholder website
   - This is the WRONG project - my domain is connected here

2. REMOVE DOMAIN FROM TEMPLATE PROJECT:
   - Click on the template project
   - Go to "Domains" tab
   - Find my domain in the list
   - Click "Remove" or "Disconnect"
   - Confirm removal

3. FIND MY REAL PROJECT:
   - Look for project named: "streamerstickprofinal"
   - It should be connected to: reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
   - This is the CORRECT project with my real code

4. CONNECT DOMAIN TO REAL PROJECT:
   - Click on "streamerstickprofinal" project
   - Go to "Domains" tab
   - Click "Add custom domain"
   - Enter my domain name
   - Connect it

5. TRIGGER DEPLOYMENT:
   - In "streamerstickprofinal" project
   - Go to "Deployments" tab
   - Click "Create deployment" → "Deploy latest commit"
   - Wait for build to complete (3-5 minutes)
   - My real website will appear!

IMPORTANT:
- Files are already in GitHub: https://github.com/reloadedfiretvteam-hash/streamerstickprofinal
- Don't try to push files - they're already there
- The problem is domain connection, not missing files
- Fix the domain connection and website will work

CLOUDFLARE PROJECTS:
- Template project (WRONG) - has my domain, shows template
- streamerstickprofinal (CORRECT) - has my real code, needs my domain

Give me step-by-step instructions to fix the domain connection.
