## 📋 SUMMARY

**You don't need to push anything - it's already in GitHub!**

**You just need to:**
1. Go to Cloudflare
2. Click "Create deployment"
3. Select "Deploy latest commit"
4. Wait for it to build

**That's it! Your new files will be live once Cloudflare finishes building.**

**Go to Cloudflare now and trigger the deployment!**
