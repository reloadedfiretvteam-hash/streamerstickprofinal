# ✅ Secrets Removed - Ready to Push

## What I Fixed
I found and removed exposed GitHub tokens from these files:
- `TROUBLESHOOT_PUSH_ISSUE.md`
- `SIMPLE_PUSH_COMMANDS.txt`
- `MASTER_REFERENCE_ALL_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- `FRESH_CLONE_SOLUTION.md`
- `COMPLETE_PROJECT_INFORMATION.md`
- `BOLT_VERIFY_AND_PUSH_ALL_FILES.txt`
- `BOLT_FRESH_CLONE_INSTRUCTIONS.txt`
- `BOLT_EXACT_FILE_INSTRUCTIONS.txt`

## What I Did
- Replaced actual tokens with placeholders like `YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN`
- Tokens are now safe and won't trigger GitHub's secret detection

## Next Steps
1. **Copy files from BXQ3Z again** to your GitHub Desktop folder
2. **Commit** in GitHub Desktop
3. **Push** - This time it should work without secret warnings!

## Important
The tokens I removed were already exposed. You should:
- Revoke those tokens in GitHub settings (if you haven't already)
- Use GitHub Desktop authentication instead (no tokens needed)

## Ready to Push!
All secrets are removed. You can now push without GitHub blocking you.
